Myo Media
=========

An OS X application which uses Myo as a general media controller
----------------------------------------------------------------

The media controls which come packaged with the Myo only work when the app to be controlled is the active window. This is annoying as it forces you to use the mouse / keyboard to navigate to iTunes / VLC before using the Myo.

Myo Media solves this problem by allowing you to control your music or other media and volume even whilst the media player application is in the background. Myo Media goes beyond the capabilities of Apple's media keys which can only control native applications by allowing you to control web based media players as well. See [BeardedSpice](https://github.com/beardedspice/beardedspice) for similar functionality without the Myo.

The actively controlled application / web-tab can be controled by making a fist and pulling your hand straight back. While continuing to make a fist, you can rotate your fist to select from the different controllable open applications / tabs. This interface looks very similar to the alt-tab application switcher.
